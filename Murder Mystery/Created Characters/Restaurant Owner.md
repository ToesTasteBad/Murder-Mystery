## Description
---
You are the owner of one of the best restaurants in the city, La Bouffe. Tonight's event is in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo, an excellent chef, and the owner and head chef of a rival restaurant with the same name. He recently died and his restaurant was passed on to his prodige, [Prodige name]. To be honest, the shift has been very good for you. [Prodige name] is pulling fewer customers than Alfredo could, while for you business is booming. That said, you always respected the dead chef, and will try your best to make a good showing tonight.
