## Description
---
You are a well-respected and widely published food critic. This event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo. An excellent chef, you enjoyed eating his food and people enjoyed reading what you wrote about it. Truly, a great loss. Now that he's gone, there's a clear hole where "best chef in town" used to be, and you get to decide who fills it. The town's remaining chef's should be looking to please you now more than ever, and they'll all be at this party. You would never be happy for the death of such an artist, but your reviews have been seeing a lot of traffic lately.

- [[Head Chef|Arthur Cooke - Head Chef]]  - You've written about his food on many occasions. Quite good, but never as good as Alfredo's.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]]  - Rigatoni's protege. He's flown under your radar until now, but has just become a major player. Defintiely someone to keep an eye on.
