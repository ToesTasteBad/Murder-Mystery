## Description
---
As a famous wine collector, you've made both friends and enemies in the world of haute cuisine. Now past middle-aged, you made a sizeable fortune in your younger years when Belon Busk bought your brain child, PayBuddy in which you still hold a 10% stake. You used that money to follow your passion, wine collection, and have done whatever it takes to get your hands on the world's rarest bottles of wine ever since. Tonight's event is in honor of renowned chef, Rigatoni Alfredo, who recently passed away. His son approached you about hosting a charity auction in his honor, and when you heard his prized bottle would be going up for bid, all you could say was yes.

- [[Rival Wine Collector|Daniel Pierce - Rival Wine Collector]]  - You've clashed at many a wine auction in the past. Pierce has won bottles from you here and there, but when you're truly determined to acquire a particularly fine specimen, you always come out on top, no matter how much he bids you up.
- [[Vinter|Giovanni Bishop - Vinter]]  - You've often considered yourself lucky to live so near to one who makes such fine wines. Indeed, his vintages make up a sizeable fraction of your collection, and you consider them to be reliable go-to's. You are one of Giovanni's top investors.
- [[Realtor|Penelope Hunt - Realtor]]  - She's recently been hounding you to sell your mansion. She must have received quite the offer, but you don't plan on moving anytime soon.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Rigatoni's son. You never knew him that well, but loved dining at his father's restaurant. He's asked you to host tonight's event, and you were happy to oblige.
