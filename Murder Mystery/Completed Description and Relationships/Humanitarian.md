## Description
---
You are an accomplished humanitarian and the director of the non-profit, Fine Cuisine for Impoverished Teens. You recently found love in an unexpected place, and married a wealthy oil baron who you would have described as greedy, but has seemed eager to turn over a new leaf. Tonight, you're attending a charity auction in honor of famous chef, Rigatoni Alfredo. Your husband plans on making a large donation, and you're interested in whether or not the organizer has a specific charity in mind. If they don't, you have just the one to recommend.
