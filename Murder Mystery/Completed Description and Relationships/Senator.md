## Description
---
By day, you're a senator for the state of Minnesota. By night, an enjoyer of the finest cuisine this city has to offer. This event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, an incredible chef. You were a frequent patron of his restaurant and have spent many evenings chatting with and enjoying the fine cocktails prepared by his bartender, [[Bartender|Frances Larsen]]. In your spouse's opinion, you've been chatting with him a bit too much. As a senator, you're privy to a fair amount of classified information, and you may have recently let some state secrets slip. You trust the man, but your spouse seems very nervous about the whole thing. You've come here tonight to make absolutely certain he stays quiet. And of course, you've never been one to say no to a fancy party.
