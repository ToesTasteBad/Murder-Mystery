# Name: Daniel Pierce
# Role: Rival Wine Collector
# Played By: Levi Butts

## Description
---
For the last several decades, you've been a relatively popular crime author, but that's only a way of funding your true passion, wine collection. You love talking about wine, having a bottle to pop open for special occasions, and impressing people cultured enough to know about it with your rarer bottles. You normally have the means to get the bottles you really want, but a certain rival wine collector always manages to swipe the very best ones out from under you with his seemingly infinite funds, and he never sells. Tonight's event is a charity auction in honor of the recently deceased, world renowned chef, Rigatoni Alfredo, and you've heard that a particularly magnificent bottle of wine will be up for bid. Maybe this is the night your luck turns around?

## Relationships
---
- [[Wine Collector|Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector]]  - Your rival, and the host of tonight's party. He's too rich for his own good, and he always manages to outbid you on the very best bottles. You get some satisfaction from pushing his bids up to extravagant amounts.
- [[Art Collector|Reuben Barlow - Art Collector]]  - A dear friend of yours. You have different tastes, but get along quite well. You'll often share your art and wine with one another. In order to bid on tonight's bottle, you sold a piece of art that Reuben had given you as a gift.
- [[Detective|Keith Hartley - Detective]]  - Not all rare bottles of wine are simply up for auction. You've had Hartley snoop out some fine specimens in the past.
