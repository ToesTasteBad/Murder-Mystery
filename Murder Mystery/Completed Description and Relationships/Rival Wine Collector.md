# Name: Daniel Pierce
# Role: Rival Wine Collector
# Played By: Levi Butts

## Description
---
For the last several decades, you've been a relatively popular crime author, but that's only a way of funding your true passion, wine collection. You love talking about wine, having a bottle to pop open for special occasions, and impressing people cultured enough to know about it with your rarer bottles. You normally have the means to get the bottles you really want, but a certain rival wine collector always manages to swipe the very best ones out from under you with his seemingly infinite funds, and he never sells. Tonight's event is a charity auction in honor of the recently deceased, world renowned chef, Rigatoni Alfredo, and you've heard that a particularly magnificent bottle of wine will be up for bid. Maybe this is the night your luck turns around?

## Relationships
---
- [[Wine Collector|Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector]]  - Your rival, and the host of tonight's party. He's too rich for his own good, and he always manages to outbid you on the very best bottles. You get some satisfaction from pushing his bids up to extravagant amounts.
- [[Art Collector|Reuben Barlow - Art Collector]]  - A dear friend of yours. You have different tastes, but get along quite well. You'll often share your art and wine with one another. In order to bid on tonight's bottle, you sold a piece of art that Reuben had given you as a gift.
- [[Detective|Keith Hartley - Detective]]  - Not all rare bottles of wine are simply up for auction. You've had Hartley snoop out some fine specimens in the past.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1:
	- task1:  Inspect the bottle of wine being auctioned to see for yourself what all the fuss is about. It's a bottle you've been wanting for a while and would very much like to win it!
	- task2:  Speak to [[Wine Collector|Gregor]] and try to get a feel for how interested in this bottle he is.
	- task3:  Confide in [[Detective|Keith Hartley]] that you recently sold Peinture Célèbre, a painting Reuben had given you as a gift. Show him the receipt. You're hoping that you can use the money to win tonight's bottle.
	- task4: Attend the auction and bid on that bottle! With the money from the painting you sold, you could comfortably bid up to $100,000.
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: Seek out Giovanni and see if you can strike up a business deal now that Gregor is gone.
	- task2: Talk with Anton and tell him that you've never been happier to lose a bid on a bottle of wine. Mention that surely either of us would have been able to taste if something was off.
	- task3:
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: If Reuben Barlow asks you about Giovanni Bishop, tell him you don't know anything about the man except that he makes good wine.
	- task2: Ask Ghost Gregor what happened to the '66 Boisson
	- task3
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I did not kill Gregor Toussaint. It's true that he was a constant thorn in my side, but even so, I didn't kill him. As I told Keith Hartley earlier in the evening. I recently sold a lovely painting I had been given as a gift so that I would have funds to bid on this bottle. I wouldn't have done that if I had intended to poison it.
	- Frank: I had no motive to kill Frank Larsen
	- Orzo: I had no motive to kill Orzo Alfredo
