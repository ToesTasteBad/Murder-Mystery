# Role: Head Chef
# Played By: Kob Meyers

## Description
---
You are the head chef at La Bouffe, one of the finest restaurants in the city. Tonight's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, a chef you've always respected and considered a rival for years. People often compare you, and a review by [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport]] cemented him as the better chef in the minds of many. You never held it against Alfredo though. You both drove each other to improve your cooking, and you wouldn't be the chef you are today without him.

## Relationships

- [[Bartender|Frances Larsen - Bartender]]  - Came to La Bouffe after Alfredo's death. He refuses to cater his drinks to your dishes. Very annoying fellow.
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]]  - He's been driving you particularly hard since Alfredo's death. He wants everyone to know who the best chef in town is now that he's gone.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]] - Alfredo's prodige. A formidable chef and a hard worker. You look forward to watching him grow.
- [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport - Food Critic]] - Responsible for your reputation as the second best chef in town. You haven't spoken, but you get the feeling they're a bit of a snob.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]] - Alfredo's protege. A formidable chef and a hard worker. You look forward to watching him grow.
