# Name: Arthur Cooke
# Role: Head Chef
# Played By: Kob Meyers

## Description
---
You are the head chef at La Bouffe, one of the finest restaurants in Flavortown. Tonight's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, a chef you've always respected and considered a rival for years. People often compare you, and a review by [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport]] cemented him as the better chef in the minds of many. You never held it against Alfredo though. You both drove each other to improve your cooking, and you wouldn't be the chef you are today without him.

## Relationships
---
- [[Bartender|Frances Larsen - Bartender]]  - Came to La Bouffe after Alfredo's death. He refuses to cater his drinks to your dishes. Very annoying fellow.
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]]  - He's been driving you particularly hard since Alfredo's death. He wants everyone to know who the best chef in town is now that he's gone.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]] - Alfredo's prodige. A formiddable chef and a hard worker. You look forward to watching him grow.
- [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport - Food Critic]] - Responsible for your reputation as the second best chef in town. You haven't spoken, but you get the feeling he's a bit of a snob.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1: 
	- task1:  Inspect the bottle of wine being auctioned to see for yourself what all the fuss is about. It's a good bottle, you'll probably bid though you don't expect to win given the competition.
	- task2: Speak to Harvey and comment that you look forward to reading his updated reviews when he gets around to them.
	- task3: Speak to Puck and offer your condolences.
	- task4: Confide in [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell]] that ever since Frank started at La Bouffe, it's been impossible to convince him to cooperate on a menu. You're reaching your wit's end.
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: If Erik Howell bugs you about working with Frank Larsen, prove that you're making an effort by showing him the recipe card you came up with to pair with one of his cocktails.
	- task2: Make sure you attend the evening's second auction.
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: If asked about your plans, say that you've got some incredible new dishes in the works, and that if they really want to know about them, they'll have to swing by La Bouffe.
	- task2: Find Diana Saville and ask her if she'd design something special for La Bouffe, to help you elevate your restaurant.
	- task3
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I had no motive to kill Gregor Toussaint
	- Frank: I did not kill Frank Larsen. I admit that we had our differences. For a long time, neither of us was willing to work with the other, but I've turned over a new leaf. Look at the recipe card I made up. It proves that I had been willing to compromise with Frank before he was killed. I wouldn't have gone to the effort if I was just going to kill the guy.
	- Orzo: I had no motive to kill Orzo Alfredo
