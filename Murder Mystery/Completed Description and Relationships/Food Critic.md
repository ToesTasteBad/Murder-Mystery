# Role: Food Critic
# Played By: Jon Wagner

## Description
---
You are a well-respected and widely published food critic. This event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo. An excellent chef, you enjoyed eating his food and people enjoyed reading what you wrote about it. Truly, a great loss. Now that he's gone, there's a clear hole where "best chef in town" used to be, and you get to decide who fills it. The town's remaining chef's should be looking to please you now more than ever, and they'll all be at this party. You would never be happy for the death of such an artist, but your reviews have been seeing a lot of traffic lately.

## Relationships

- [[Head Chef|Arthur Cooke - Head Chef]]  - You've written about his food on many occasions. Quite good, but never as good as Alfredo's.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]]  - Rigatoni's protege. He's flown under your radar until now, but has just become a major player. Definitely someone to keep an eye on.
- [[Sommelier|Anton Sherman - Sommelier]] - You and Anton have been talking about starting a shared review column together, talking about the best food and wine pairings in the city and surrounding areas. You two are still figuring out the details.
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]] - You and Poppy are good golfing buddies. Between the two of you, you know an awful lot about the city's restaurants and enjoy sharing the latest food related gossip.
- [[Vinter|Giovanni Bishop - Vinter]] - Giovanni is another good golf buddy of your's but, has been a bit caught up at the vinyard of late and has been unable to join much at all this season.
