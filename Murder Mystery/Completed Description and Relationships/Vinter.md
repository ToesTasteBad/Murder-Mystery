## Relationships
---
- [[Art Collector|Rueben Barlow - Art Collector]]  - You are in possession of an original Devoux painting. It is a prized piece of your art collection and you have no intention of parting with it, though you know Rueben has been vying to get it off you for a while now.
- [[Wine Collector|Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector]] - Gergor has been an esteemed customer of yours for a while. You've sold many expensive bottles to him over the years and you've developed quite the relationship. He is one of your top investors at the vineyard.
- [[Sommelier|Anton Sherman - Sommelier]] - You have been in business with Anton for a number of years now. He stamps his signature on the labels of the bottles he most recommends. These bottles always sell the best. However, costs at the vineyard are running high and you are looking for ways to save money. You've informed Anton you will be cutting his kick back percentage.
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]] - You and Poppy are both members of a golfing foursome!  However, you've been far too busy at the vineyard this season and haven't been able to get out at all. You are hoping to catch up with them on the latest gossip at the event.
- [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport - Food Critic]] - Good golfing buddy of yours! 
- [[Mayor|Jim Hudson - Mayor]] - Another one of your golfing buddies. You used to golf even before he became mayor.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1: 
	- task1:  Inspect the bottle of wine being auctioned to see for yourself what all the fuss is about. If asked, you are definetly interested, but unsure if you'll bid.
	- task2: If approached by Reuben, tell him you don't want to sell the Devoux painting, but you might have to. Gregor missed the last investor meeting and you have concerns he's been spending too much on specialty wines and won't be able to continue to make his investments. (Give your letter from Gregor to Reuben.) Ask Reuben to talk to you about the Devoux again after the wine auction, you might sell if Gregor wins the bottle.
	- task3:  After inspecting the bottle, approach Gregor and tell him to not bid on the bottle, its not worth his time.
	- task4: See if you can convince Harvey to also say something to Gregor about not bidding on the wine.
	- task5: If you are really up to it, see if you can convince Poppy of the same thing as well!
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: If asked about selling your Devoux, begrudgingly negotiate a high price.
	- task2: If approached by Daniel Pierce with an investment offer, tell him you'll accept as long as he doesn't get carried away with extravagant wines like Gregor did.
	- task3:
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: If Anton approaches about the kick back, inform him you've managed to secure some additional revenue streams and that he should be able to restore your cut.
	- task2: You've had a long night. Order a drink from Ghost Frank.
	- task3:
	- Identify the murderer(s)!
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I killed Gregor Toussaint... But it was an accident! For years, he's been one of my primary investors, but his exorbitant bidding in wine auctions just like this one have been making his payments less and less consistent. And it's all thanks to Daniel Pierce! If you didn't make such a habit of pushing up Gregor's bids, it never would have come to this. I tried convincing him not to bid tonight. My hope was that Daniel would win the bottle, and that with his competition eliminated, Gregor could have the funds to both win wine auctions and support my vineyard. Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way... This won't have a negative impact on our new investment deal... right Daniel?

	- Orzo: I had no motive to kill Orzo Alfredo
