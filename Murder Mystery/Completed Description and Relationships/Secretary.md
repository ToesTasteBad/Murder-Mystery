## Description
---
You are a Secretary at one of the law offices in town. As such, you tend to overhear quite a lot! You don't actively eavesdrop and actually do your best to avoid it, but that can only be so effective. The event tonight is an auction for a chef who has passed that is very well respected. You are in attendance with your boyfriend, Reuben Barlow.

## Relationships
---
- [[Art Collector|Reuben Barlow - Art Collector]]  - You two have been dating for a number of years.
- [[Lawyer|Milo Steinwell - Lawyer]]  - Milo is one of the Lawyers who works at your office. You and him get along well enough, though you've overheard him talking about the Mayor a number of times.
- [[Humanitarian|Elizabeth Cain - Humanitarian]]  - You use to work as Elizabeth's secretary at the non-profit she is now director of, Fine Cuisine for Impoverished Teens. She was a great boss, but being at a non-profit the pay and benefits couldn't come close to what you got offered at the Law offices.
- [[Franchise Owner|Darren Kaufman - Franchise Owner]] - Darren is the owner of WcRonald's. You had a run in with him two years ago, after you slipped and injured yourself at his restaurant with no signage posted. You sued, using a lawyer you don't work with so as not to draw suspicion, and ultimately settled very heavily in your favor.
