## Description
---
You are a Secretary at one of the law offices in town. As such, you tend to over hear quite a lot! You don't actively ease drop and actual do your best to avoid it, but that can only be so effective. The event tonight is an auction for a chef who has passed that is very well respected. You are in attendance as a plus one with, the Art Dealer, who didn't want to go alone!

## Relationships
---
- [[Art Collector|Reuben Barlow - Art Collector]]  - You two have been dating for a number of years.
- [[Lawyer|Milo Steinwell - Lawyer]]  - Milo is one of the Lawyers who works at your office.  You and him get along well enough, though you've overheard him talking about the Mayor a number of times.
- [[Humanitarian|Elizabeth Cain - Humanitarian]]  - You use to work as Elizabeth's secretary at the non-profit she is now director of, Fine Cuisine for Impoverished Teens. She was a great boss, but being at a non-profit the pay and benefits couldn't come close to what you got offered at the Law offices.
- [[Franchise Owner|Darren Kaufman - Franchise Owner]] - Darren is the owner of WcRonald's. You had a run in with him two years ago, after you tripped and fell at his restaurant with no signage posted. You sued, using a lawyer you don't work with so as not to draw suspicion, and ultimately settled very heavily in your favor. However, Darren doesn't particaluarly care for you much after the incident and that is just fine by you!
