## Description
---
You are a lawyer and are well acquainted with most if not all of the people at tonight's event. Which is a charity auction for the late chef Rigatoni Alfredo. You've helped just about all of them out of a sticky situation once or twice, and if you were a more vain person, would be holding it over their heads. However, things have been quiet for a while, which has been a good change of pace.

## Relationships
---
- [[Realtor|Penelope Hunt - Realtor]]  - An old friend from college! You never expected her to end up as a realtor, but she seems to be doing quite well for herself, and hasn't been involved in any legal trouble you're aware of.
- [[Mayor|James Hudson - Mayor]]  - Now here's a man with a complicated legal history. You've defended him twice in the past, and then he won the election because the skeleton's were pulled out of his opponent's closet! He's asked for your discretion.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - You are helping him manage his father's estate. (What a multi-talented lawyer you are!) He's hinted that this auction could end up being quite profitable for you. 
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]]  - Your wife!
- [[Secretary|Rakeeta Brown - Secretary]]  - Rakeeta is the Secretary who works at your office.  She is nice and does her job well. You two have a very cordial work relationship.
