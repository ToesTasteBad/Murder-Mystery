# Name: Poppy Steinwell
# Role: Health Inspector
# Played By: Ella Evers

## Description
---
You are Flavortown's health inspector. As a result, you're familiar with many of the folks in the restaurant industry who treat you with differing levels of respect. Tonight's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo. He was a good man with high standards for health and safety. You've heard Rigatoni's Protege, Puck, will be taking over Rigatoni's now that he has passed away, and need to make sure he's aware of your high standards.

## Relationships
---
- [[Lawyer|Milo Steinwell - Lawyer]]  - Your Husband! He's helping manage the estate of the late chef Rigatoni Alfredo.
- [[Vinter|Giovanni Bishop - Vinter]]  - One of your golfing buddies, you used to catch up on the course every week, but this season he's been too busy at the vineyard to get out at all. Hopefully you can do some catching up tonight.
- [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport - Food Critic]]  - Another member of your golfing foursome, you two are always discussing the latest food related gossip.
- [[Mayor|Jim Hudson - Mayor]]  - Your final golfing buddy. You used to golf even before he became mayor.
- [[Franchise Owner|Darren Kaufman - Franchise Owner]] - Owner of WcRonald's, a huge fast food chain. You've cost him thousands at this point in health and safety lawsuits, but the standards at his restaurants just never seem to improve.  He's probably not too happy with you, but you're just doing your job (and getting some juicy food horror stories).
