## Description
---
Tonight's event is to commemorate your father, Rigatoni Alfredo, who recently passed away. You were very close. He taught you how to cook, and even though you didn't have the talent to do it professionally, you enjoy making his recipes for your family on a daily basis. Your older brother, Orzo Alfredo, is in charge of managing your father's estate, and is the organizer of tonight's event. He and your father didn't get along, and you don't often see eye to eye. He's auctioning off your father's prized possessions for charity, which you have mixed feelings about.

## Relationships

- [[Food TV Host|Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host]]  - She did an episode on some of your father's most famous dishes and had you on as a guest chef. She seems nice, but a bit more focused on the showmanship than the cooking.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Your older brother. He was never interested in the family business and hasn't been around much. You had assumed that managing your father's estate would fall to you, but it's good to see him so gung-ho.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]]  - Your father's protege. Maybe that could have been you if you'd had a bit more talent. He took over your father's restaurant when he passed.
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]]  - The owner of La Bouffe, Alfredo's main competition in town.
