# Name: Ziti Alfredo
# Role: Second Child
# Played By: Tom Tow

## Description
---
Tonight's event is to commemorate your father, Rigatoni Alfredo, who recently passed away. You were very close. He taught you how to cook, and even though you didn't have the talent to do it professionally, you enjoy making his recipes for your family on a daily basis. Your older brother, Orzo Alfredo, is in charge of managing your father's estate, and is the organizer of tonight's event. He and your father didn't get along, and you don't often see eye to eye. He decided to auction off your father's prized possessions for charity, including his chef knife, which you weren't happy about.

## Relationships
---
- [[Food TV Host|Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host]]  - She did an episode on some of your father's most famous dishes and had you on as a guest chef. She seems nice, but a bit more focused on the showmanship than the cooking.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Your older brother. He was never interested in the family business and hasn't been around much. You had assumed that managing your father's estate would fall to you, but it's good to see him so gung-ho.
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]]  - Your father's protege. Maybe that could have been you if you'd had a bit more talent. He took over your father's restaurant when he passed.
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]]  - The owner of La Bouffe, Alfredo's main competition in town.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1: 
	- task1: When Reuben Barlow speaks to you, lament that your brother, Orzo, isn't treating your father's knife with the respect you would have. You would have preferred to keep it in the family, but you don't have the funds to win it in tonight's bid.
	- task2: When Darren Kaufman speaks to you, also lament to him about the knife.
	- task3: When Stephen Ramos speaks to you, again lament to him about the knife.
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: If approached about Rigatoni's old house, complain that if Orzo hasn't sold it by now he probably will soon just like everything else dad use to own!
	- task2:
	- task3: Instead of attending the second auction, stay upstairs and admit to Jodi that the knife being sold isn't actually your father's. You couldn't bare to see it fall into the hands of some stranger, so you had swapped it out a few days back.
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: Order a Midori Sour from Frank Larsen's secret menu.
	- task2: Talk to Erik Howell and see if Orzo has tried to sell him Rigatoni's restaurant as well. Orzo seems to be selling off everything else!
	- task3
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I had no motive to kill Gregor Toussaint
	- Frank: I had no motive to kill Frank Larsen
	- Orzo: I did not kill Orzo Alfredo. It's true that he had swooped in, selling off all of our father's prized possessions without warning, most importantly his chef's knife. But as I confessed to Jodi during the second auction, I secretly stole the actual knife a few days ago, replacing it with a fake. With the knife safely in my possession, I had no real reason to kill Orzo.
