# Played By: Andrew Stelter

## Description
---
You are a professional wine taster, and your reviews are some of the most trusted in the industry. Tonight's event is in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo, an incredible chef who recently passed away. He would always come to you for advice. Also in attendance are a couple of wine collectors. One is the host. They may love wine, but not the same way you do. Your pallete can detect flavors they could only dream of, and yet they keep some of the world's best bottles to themselves, treating them as nothing more than status symbols. If you play your cards right, you may be able to get a taste of some of their hoarded wines.

## Relationships
---
- [[Wine Collector|Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector]] - You've had some disagreements over the years on what makes a bottle of wine truly excellent. He may claim he knows what he's talking about, but you see right through his shallow knowledge and experience.
- [[Food TV Host|Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host]] - You have reached out to Jodi, who is an old friend of yours, about doing an episode all about wine. You are hoping some new exposure could boost the need for your services a bit.
- [[Vinter|Giovanni Bishop - Vinter]] - You have been in business with Giovanni for a number of years now. You stamp your label on the bottles of his you recommend and you get a certain percentage kick back for every bottle sold. You two have come to a bit of a disagreement though, as he is trying to cut your kick back percentage.
- [[Food Critic|Harvey Davenport - Food Critic]] - You and Harvey have been talking about starting a shared review column together, talking about the best food and wine pairings in Flavortown and surrounding areas. You two are still figuring out the details.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1: 
	- task1:  Inspect the bottle of wine being auctioned to see for yourself what all the fuss is about. It is quite the specimen and you would very much like to win it!
	- task2:  Speak to Jodi and ask if she has thought any more about doing a wine episode together.
	- task3: Confide in Harvey how you feel about Gregor's relationship with wine: His money and interest do NOT make up for a weak palate.
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: Speak to Harvey about the new column you are starting. Provide him the sample interview you did to give him a better idea of the type of sommelier you are.
	- task2: If approached about Gregor, half heartedly share your condolences and then muse about what will happen to his collection.
	- task3
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: Approach Giovanni about the cutting of your kick back on the wines you stamp. Tell him people are writing articles about you now and you deserve more.
	- task2: Ask Ghost Gregor about the '66 Boisson that he opened earlier.
	- task3:
	- Identify the murderer(s)!
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I did not kill Gregor Toussaint. It's true that he and I had our differences. Him with his boorish and uncultured palate, and me with my ascended sense of taste, but I certainly didn't kill the man. If any of you have read my recent BuzzFeed interview, it's clear that I would never tarnish a bottle of wine with anything. Certainly not poison.
	- Frank: I had no motive to kill Frank Larsen
	- Orzo: I had no motive to kill Orzo Alfredo
