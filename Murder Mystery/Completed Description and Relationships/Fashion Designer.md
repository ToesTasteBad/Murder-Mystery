# Name: Diana Saville
# Role: Fashion Designer
# Played By: Emily Brossart

## Description
---
You are a designer of high end fashion, running your own label, Saville. By chance, you met world renowned chef Rigatoni Alfredo when you were first breaking into the fashion world, and he was happy to impart his wisdom on navigating the crowds of the elite. You became good friends, and a few months ago, you began frequenting his restraunt to gather inspiration for your next line. You were recently saddened, but not surprised, by the news of his passing. Tonight's event is a charity auction in his honor.

## Relationships
---
- [[Bartender|Frank Larsen - Bartender]]  - Your boyfriend. He was the bartender at Rigatoni's restaurant, and Rigatoni gave him his seal of approval.
- [[Model|Blair Ashleigh - Model]]  - A model you've never been able to please, she refuses to wear your designs. You've seen her hanging around with Rigatoni's protege, Puck, at the restraunt.
- [[Food TV Host|Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host]]  - You've been working on a new line of high fashion cooking attire recently, and are hoping to gain Jodi's endorsement, as she's the biggest name on Food TV
- [[Author|Rebecca Ramos - Author]] - She's married to Senator Ramos, and commissioned you to make her a fancy dress for her first State Dinner, but has been slow on payment since then. It's not like they don't have the money either, and that dress completely stole the show.
