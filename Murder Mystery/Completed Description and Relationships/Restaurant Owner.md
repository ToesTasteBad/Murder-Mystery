# Name: Erik Howell
# Role: Restaurant Owner
# Played By: Garrett Zelmer

## Description
---
You are the owner of one of the best restaurants in the city, La Bouffe. Tonight's event is in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo, an excellent chef, and the owner and head chef of a rival restaurant with the same name. He recently died and his restaurant was passed on to his prodige, Puck Augustini. To be honest, the shift has been very good for you. Augustini is pulling fewer customers than Alfredo could, while for you business is booming. That said, you always respected the dead chef, and will try your best to make a good showing tonight.

## Relationships
---
- [[Protege|Puck Augustini - Protege]]  - Now that he's taken over Alfredo's, he's your main competition in town. Frankly though, he seems to be a bit out of his depth.
- [[Head Chef|Arthur Cooke - Head Chef]]  - Your head chef. He's talented, and now that Rigatoni's gone, he has a chance to cement himself as number one
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]]  - Poppy always seems eager to find something wrong with your restaurant, but you keep the place fit as a fiddle and clean as a whistle.
- [[Bartender|Frank Larsen - Bartender]]  - He used to work with Alfredo, but was apparently less interested in working with his protege. When he asked if you were hiring, you leapt at the opportunity.
- [[Second Child|Ziti Alfredo - Second Child]]  - Rigatoni's younger son. He seems like a good enough guy.
- [[Food TV Host|Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host]]  - You're dating!
- [[Wine Collector|Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector]]  - Is in possession of a '66 Boisson DÃ©licieuse, rumored to be a trancendent vintage. You know he's unlikely to share, but you can't help but bring it up when you run into each other.
