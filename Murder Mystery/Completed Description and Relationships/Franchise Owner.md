# Role: Franchise Owner
# Played By: Luke Peterson

## Description
---
You are the owner of WcRonald's, an international fast food chain. This town's elite chefs and restaurant owners don't respect your methods, but far more people have enjoyed your food than all of theirs put together. Tonight's event is to honor the great chef Rigatoni Alfredo who has recently passed. The event is an auction in which some of his most prized possessions are up for sale. You tried convincing him to partner up, by adding his name on a new menu item, several years ago (his name would sell *a lot* of food) but he was never interested. Now that his son has taken over however, there might be a chance. You've already spoken briefly and you're hoping to get down to brass tacks at tonight's event.

## Relationships
---
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]]  - She's given you a fair amount of trouble in the past. The fact of the matter is that it's more profitable to deal with a few health and safety lawsuits than it is to implement stringent policies at all of your restaurants.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Rigatoni was never interested in going into business, but Orzo, who now has claim to the family name, might be a different story.
- [[Author|Rebecca Ramos - Author]]  - You used to be a fan of her work until she blatantly wrote a character inspired by you into her stories. And not a very flattering one at that.
- [[Secretary|Rakeeta Brown - Secretary]] - Rakeeta fell at one of your restaurants two years ago and had the gall to sue you over it! The court fees and time were getting to be too much and so you ended up settling just to get it over with. It cost you an arm and a leg.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1: 
	- task1: Mention to Orzo Alfredo that you'd be interested in using his father's name on your menu. It could be lucrative for both of you.
	- task2: Give your condolences to Ziti on the loss of his father.
	- task3: If someone approaches you asking about any new business dealings you've been involved in, tell them you and Orzo Alfredo are going to be going into buisness together.
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: If someone tell you something about your partnership with Orzo, confront Orzo about it.
	- task2: Mention to Rebecca Ramos that you don't appreciate the way she portrays you in her books.
	- task3: Ask Rakeeta Brown if she's fallen in any other restaurants lately.
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: Order a Midori Sour from Frank Larsen's secret menu.
	- task2: Complain to Jodi Souvid about Orzo's rude behavior.
	- task3: If another business opportunity is presented to you, brag about it to everyone who will listen.
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I had no motive to kill Gregor Toussaint
	- Frank: I had no motive to kill Frank Larsen
	- Orzo: I did not kill Orzo Alfredo. He did do me dirty. He implied that he was interested in going into business, but actually, he was just using me to get a head start on his own chain restaurant. I wasn't happy about it, but when Jodi offered to partner up, none of that mattered anymore. How could I stay mad about Orzo when something so much better had come along?
