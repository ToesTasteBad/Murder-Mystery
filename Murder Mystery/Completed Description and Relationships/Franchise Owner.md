## Description
---
You are the owner of WcRonald's, an international fast food chain. This town's elite chefs and restaurant owners don't respect your methods, but far more people have enjoyed your food than all of theirs put together. Tonight's event is to honor the great chef Rigatoni Alfredo who has recently passed. The event is an auction in which some of his most prized possessions are up for sale. You tried convincing him to partner up, by adding his name on a new menu item, several years ago (his name would sell *a lot* of food) but he was never interested. Now that his son has taken over however, there might be a chance. You've already spoken briefly and you're hoping to get down to brass tacks at tonight's event.

## Relationships
---
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]]  - She's given you a fair amount of trouble in the past. The fact of the matter is that it's more profitable to deal with a few health and safety lawsuits than it is to implement stringent policies at all of your restaurants.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Rigatoni was never interested in going into business, but Orzo, who now has claim to the family name, might be a different story.
- [[Author|Rebecca Ramos - Author]]  - You used to be a fan of her work until she blatantly wrote a character inspired by you into her stories. And not a very flattering one at that.
- [[Secretary|Rakeeta Brown - Secretary]] - Rakeeta fell at one of your restaurants two years ago and had the gall to sue you over it! The court fees and time were getting to be too much and so you ended up settling just to get it over with. It cost you an arm and a leg.
