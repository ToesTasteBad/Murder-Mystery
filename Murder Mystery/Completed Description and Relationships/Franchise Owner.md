## Description
---
You are the owner of WcRonald's, an international fast food chain. Your friends haven't always taken you very seriously as you don't serve exquisite cuisine, which is a bit annoying. You make good money just like the rest of them so what should it matter! Tonight's event is to honor the great chef Rigatoni Alfredo who has recently passed. The event is an auction in which some of his most prized possessions are up for sale. You attempted to convince Rigatoni to franchise his brand many years ago, in hopes of providing some more legitamcy to your friends, but he always refused. Now that his son has taken over however, you appear to have convinced him that franchising may be the way to go! You are hoping to solidify this postition at the event.

## Relationships
---
- [[Health Inspector|Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector]]  - She's given you a fair amount of trouble in the past. The fact of the matter is that it's more profitable to deal with a few health and safety lawsuits than it is to implement stringent policies at all of your restaurants.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Rigatoni was never interested in going into business, but Orzo, who now has claim to the family name, might be a different story.
- [[Author|Rebecca Ramos - Author]]  - You used to be a fan of her work until she blatantly wrote a character inspired by you into her stories. And not a very flattering one at that.
- [[Secretary|Rakeeta Brown - Secretary]] - Rakeeta fell at your WcRonald's restuarant two years ago a had the gall to sue you over it! The court fees and time were getting to be too much and so you ended up settling just to get it over with, though it ended up costing you! You two don't along.
