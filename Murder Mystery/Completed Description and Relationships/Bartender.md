## Description
---
You are a world renowned bartender who worked with Rigatoni Alfredo. The two of you got on splendidly. You used to make incredible pairings of drink and food, but now he's gone and so is that magic.  Since his death things haven't been the same, so, looking for a shake up, you've decided to take a job at a different restaurant in town, La Bouffe. As a final courtesy to Rigatoni, you've volunteered your services for tonight's charity auction

## Relationships
---
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]] - Your new boss.  He was excited to bring you on board, but is concerned with the tension between you and his head Chef
- [[Head Chef|Arthur Cooke - Head Chef]]  - The Chef at your new restraunt, La Bouffe.  While claiming to be a premier chef, he refuses to create a dish that will pair nicely with any of your signature cocktails.
- [[Senator|Stephen Ramos - Senator]]  - An old regular from your days at Rigatoni's, he loved hanging out at the bar, sipping a drink, and airing out all of his work grievances.  Very good tipper towards the end of your tenure there. 
- [[Fashion Designer|Diana Saville - Fashion Designer]] - An old friend of Rigatoni's who started recently frequenting the restraunt to gather inspiration for her newest line.  You two hit it off and have been dating for a while now.  You're here together, but also both working tonight. 
- [[Protege|Puck Agustini - Rigatoni's Protege]] - The Chef that was training under Rigatoni until his death, a nice enough fellow, but you two lacked the same chemistry you had with Rigatoni
- [[Celebrity|Sophia Bird - Celebrity]] - She asked you to start using her signature gin in your cocktails... but it sort of sucks.
