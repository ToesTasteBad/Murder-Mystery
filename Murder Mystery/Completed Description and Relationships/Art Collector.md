## Description
---
You are an art collector and proprieter of Gallery 16 on the West side of town. You've sold numerous paintings to many in attendance at tonight's event. The event in question? An auction for world class chef, Rigatoni Alfredo, who has recently passed. You sold him a remarkable piece a number of years back, and he never quite got around to paying you. You are hoping to use tonight's event to get more details on the fate of this painting and to speak with whichever Alfredo boy has current ownership in regards to debt owed.

## Relationships
---
- [[Vinter|Giovanni Bishop - Vinter]]  - The owner of an original Devoux. He claims he'll never part with it, but everyone has their price.
- [[Rival Wine Collector|Daniel Pierce - Rival Wine Collector]]  - A good friend. You listen to all of his wine ramblings, and in return, he listens to all of your insight on art.
- [[Model|Blair Ashleigh - Model]]  - Recently wore a print of one of the pieces in your collection during a photo shoot. A little bit blasphemous, but the publicity was worth it.
- [[Detective|Keith Hartley - Detective]]  - He's been seen snooping around your gallery. This makes you a bit nervous because, to be honest, not all of your pieces were acquired by entirely *legal* methods.
- [[Secretary|Rakeeta Brown - Secretary]] - You two have been dating for a number of years.
