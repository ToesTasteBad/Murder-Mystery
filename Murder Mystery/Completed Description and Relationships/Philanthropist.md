## Description
---
You are a prominent business man who has made his fortune through oil. Your oil company has been in your family for generations and has made you very wealthy. You were content to hoard your wealth until you met your now-wife, an incredible woman who taught you how fullfilling it can be to give. Your new mission is to give as much as you can to worthy charities before you die, and tonight's event may offer an opportunity to do just that! The famous chef, Rigatoni Alfedo, has recently passed away, and a charity auction is being held in his honor.
