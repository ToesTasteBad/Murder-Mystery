# Name: Puck Augustini
# Role: Protege
# Played By: Bailey Koppen

## Description
---
Tonight's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, the world's greatest chef. He taught you everything you know, and after he passed, he left his restaurant to you. He also left some big shoes to fill, and despite your skill as a chef, you've been feeling the pressure to live up to his reputation. His son, Orzo Alfredo, is hosting tonight's event and auctioning off some of Rigatoni's prized possessions, including his favorite apron. You're certain that Rigatoni would have given it to you if he'd had the chance. Maybe you can win it at the auction tonight?

## Relationships
---
- [[Model|Blair Ashleigh - Model]]  - You're dating!
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]]  - The owner of La Bouffe. Now that you've taken over your mentor's restaurant, he's your top competition in town. He seems to be using the transfer as an opportunity to steal some of your business.
- [[Head Chef|Arthur Cooke - Head Chef]]  - A talented chef at La Bouffe. Your work is often compared, but there's no bad blood between you.
- [[Eldest Child|Orzo Alfredo - Eldest Child]]  - Your mentor's eldest son. Despite all the time you spent with his father, you haven't seen him around much. He seems to be more active in his father's death than he was in his life.
- [[Second Child|Ziti Alfredo - Second Child]]  - Your mentor's younger son. Now here's a man who appreciates cooking. You get the feeling he would have liked his father's mentorship if only he had more talent for cooking.
- [[Bartender|Frances Larsen - Bartender]]  - He was the bartender at Alfredo's. He seemed to do a good job and got along well with your mentor, but when Rigatoni passed, Frank left to work at La Bouffe shortly thereafter.

## Tasks
___
- ### Round 1: 
	- task1: Confide in Ziti Alfredo that Frank leaving the restaurant when you took over was hurtful. It's like he doesn't have confidence in your cooking.
	- task2: Give Orzo Alfredo your condolences and thank him for putting tonight's event together.
	- task3: Speak to Erik, about how you think it's bullshit that Rigatoni didn't just leave you his knife! You are his protege after all!
- ### Round 2:
	- task1: If asked if you'll be bidding on the knife, wax poetic. "You know, it's been said that a chef's contains a part of his very soul. Would you bid on a soul? To use it for anything other than cooking is sacrilege."
	- task2: Make sure you attend the evening's second auction.
- ### Round 3:
	- task1: Order a Midori Sour from Frank Larsen's secret menu.
	- task2: If asked about your plans, say that you've had some big shoes to fill, but you're working hard to prove yourself.
	- task3: At 9:00, give a toast upstairs in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo. Make sure to tell everyone that 9:00 was his favorite time of day.
- ### Final Statement
	- Gregor: I had no motive to kill Gregor Toussaint
	- Frank: I did not kill Frank Larsen. I'll admit that I wasn't happy about him leaving Rigatoni's just as I took over, but like I said to Elizabeth Cain before the second auction, "using a chef's knife for anything other than cooking is sacrilege." I would certainly never use one to stab someone. What's more, Blair handed me her drink just before the auction, so my hands were completely full. 
	- Orzo: I did not kill Orzo Alfredo. It's true that he appeared from nowhere, deciding to auction off items to strangers that Rigatoni almost certainly would have given to me. It's also true that he was a dick, but even so I didn't kill him. His autopsy shows that he died at 9:00pm, exactly when I was giving my toast downstairs.
