## Description
---
Tonight's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, the world's greatest chef. He taught you everything you know, and after he passed, he left his restaurant to you. He also left some big shoes to fill, and despite your skill as a chef, you've been feeling the pressure to live up to his reputation. His son, Orzo Alfredo, is hosting tonight's event and auctioning off some of Rigatoni's prized possessions, including his favorite apron. You're certain that Rigatoni would have given it to you if he'd had the chance. Maybe you can win it at the auction tonight?
