# Name: Rebecca Ramos
# Role: Author
# Played By: Libby Brossart

## Description
---
You are an accomplished author. You've spent the last 20 years of your life cranking out books in a number of genres, and for the most part, they've been hits. Unfortunately, your husband winning the senate seat has slowed that down considerably. He's charismatic enough, but also the sort of person who would forget his head if it weren't attached to his body. Just recently, he confessed that he may have let some state secrets slip to a bartender at his favorite restaurant. He says that there's nothing to worry about, but you're not so certain. You and your husband received invites to a charity auction tonight, and that bartender is supposed to be there. This will be a good opportunity to make sure your husband hasn't caused any problems for himself.

## Relationships
---
- [[Franchise Owner|Darren Kaufman - Franchise Owner]]  - Ugh. Darren Kaufman. The owner of the popular restaurant chain, WcRonalds. He's convinced that one of your characters is based on him and has been pestering you for royalties.
- [[Senator|Stephen Ramos - Senator]]  - Your husband!
- [[Humanitarian|Elizabeth Cain - Humanitarian]]  - A good friend from college. Some of your characters are actually based on her.
- [[Fashion Designer|Diana Saville - Fashion Designer]] - A very talented fashion designer. You commissioned Diana to make the dress you wore to your first state dinner, and she only made the exorbitant price clear to you after the fact. You still owe her for that, and it's not that you can't afford it, but her attitude hasn't made you rush to pay.
