## Description
---
You are a critically acclaimed actress who has just decided to take the next step into super-stardom: releasing your own brand of gin, Aeronautics. Tonight's event is to commemorate the death of the chef Rigatoni Alfredo, and all of Flavortown's movers and shakers are going to be there. This could be a great chance to get the name of your new gin out there. All it will take is signing some autographs, placing some bids, and schmoozing it up with the world of haute cuisine.
