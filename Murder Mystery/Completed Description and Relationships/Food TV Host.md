## Description

You are the host of the hit TV cooking show, Jodi's Kitchen. You've inspired and taken inspiration from the greatest chefs in Flavortown and are very well respected. You'd even go so far as to say you're a bit famous around here! You try not to let it go to your head, but that's easier said than done. Tonight's event is an auction for your dear friend and recently deceased colleague, renowned chef Rigatoni Alfredo. Some of Rigatoni's most prized possessions are up for bid and you are hoping to take home a momento.

## Relationships

- [[Second Child|Ziti Alfredo - Second Child]] - You did an earlier episode on one of Rigatoni's dishes and had him on as a guest. He knew what he was talking about cooking wise, but didn't have a talent for showbiz.
- [[Celebrity|Sophia Bird - Celebrity]] - Sophia bird is very well liked and you know that if you can convince her to come on your show, it will be a big boost to your ratings. You've reached out many times and she keeps refusing, but you are confident you can convince her otherwise!
- [[Restaurant Owner|Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner]] - You two are currently dating!
- [[Sommelier|Anton Sherman - Sommelier]] - He has reached out to you about coming on your show to do an epidose all about wine. You aren't sure how you feel about it, but Anton is an old friend so you're struggling with what to say.
- [[General|Vladimir Grey - General]] - You two went to highschool together! You weren't friends per say but  got along just fine. It's been awhile since you've seen each other.
