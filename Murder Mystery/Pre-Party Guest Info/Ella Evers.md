Hi Ella!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Poppy Steinwell.

You are the city health inspector. As a result, you're familiar with many of the folks in the restaurant industry who treat you with differing levels of respect. Saturday's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, a world-renowned chef. He was a good man with high standards for health and safety. You've heard Rigatoni's Protege, Puck, will be taking over Rigatoni's now that he has passed away, and need to make sure he's aware of your high standards.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Milo Steinwell - Lawyer: Your Husband! He's helping manage the estate of the late chef Rigatoni Alfredo.
- Giovanni Bishop - Vinter: One of your golfing buddies, you used to catch up on the course every week, but this season he's been too busy at the vineyard to get out at all. Hopefully you can do some catching up tonight.
- Harvey Davenport - Food Critic: Another member of your golfing foursome, you two are always discussing the latest food related gossip.
- Jim Hudson - Mayor: Your final golfing buddy. You used to golf even before he became mayor.
- Darren Kaufman - Franchise Owner: Owner of WcRonald's, a huge fast food chain. You've cost him thousands at this point in health and safety lawsuits, but the standards at his restaurants just never seem to improve.  He's probably not too happy with you, but you're just doing your job (and getting some juicy food horror stories).

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
