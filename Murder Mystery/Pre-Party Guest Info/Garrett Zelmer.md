Hi Garrett!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Erik Howell.

You are the owner of one of the best restaurants in Flavortown, La Bouffe. Saturday's event is in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo, an excellent chef, and the owner and head chef of a rival restaurant with the same name. He recently died and his restaurant was passed on to his protege, Puck Augustini. To be honest, the shift has been very good for you. Augustini is pulling fewer customers than Alfredo could, while for you business is booming. That said, you always respected the dead chef, and will try your best to make a good showing tonight.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Puck Augustini - Rigatoni's Protege Now that he's taken over Alfredo's, he's your main competition in town. Frankly though, he seems to be a bit out of his depth.
- Arthur Cooke - Head Chef: Your head chef. He's talented, and now that Rigatoni's gone, he has a chance to cement himself as number one
- Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector: Poppy always seems eager to find something wrong with your restaurant, but you keep the place fit as a fiddle and clean as a whistle.
- Frank Larsen - Bartender: He used to work with Alfredo, but was apparently less interested in working with his protege. When he asked if you were hiring, you leapt at the opportunity.
- Ziti Alfredo - Rigatoni's Second Child: Rigatoni's younger son. He seems like a good enough guy.
- Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host: You're dating!
- Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector: Is in possession of a '66 Boisson DÃ©licieuse, rumored to be a trancendent vintage. You know he's unlikely to share, but you can't help but bring it up when you run into each other.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
