Hi Jon!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Harvey Davenport.

You are a well-respected and widely published food critic. This event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo. An excellent chef, you enjoyed eating his food and people enjoyed reading what you wrote about it. Truly, a great loss. Now that he's gone, there's a clear hole where "best chef in town" used to be, and you get to decide who fills it. The town's remaining chef's should be looking to please you now more than ever, and they'll all be at this party. You would never be happy for the death of such an artist, but your reviews have been seeing a lot of traffic lately.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Arthur Cooke - Head Chef: You've written about his food on many occasions. Quite good, but never as good as Alfredo's.
- Puck Augustini - Rigatoni's Protege: He's flown under your radar until now, but has just become a major player. Definitely someone to keep an eye on.
- Anton Sherman - Sommelier: You and Anton have been talking about starting a shared review column together, talking about the best food and wine pairings in the city and surrounding areas. You two are still figuring out the details.
- Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector: You and Poppy are good golfing buddies. Between the two of you, you know an awful lot about the city's restaurants and enjoy sharing the latest food related gossip.
- Giovanni Bishop - Vinter: Giovanni is another good golf buddy of yours, but has been a bit caught up at the vineyard of late and has been unable to play much at all this season.
- Jim Hudson - Mayor: Another one of your golfing buddies. You used to golf even before he became mayor.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
