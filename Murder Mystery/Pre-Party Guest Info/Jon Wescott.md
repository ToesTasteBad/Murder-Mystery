Hi Jon!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Keith Hartley.

You are a detective for the city and significant other to Sophia Bird. Her friends are a bit... hoity-toity for your tastes, but that hasn't stopped you from accompanying her to Saturday's event. An auction commemorating Rigatoni Alfredo, a world renowned chef. You've never met him personally but have heard all the ravings! You are sure the food must be good all things considered and with how tough work has been lately, you're looking forward to a night off, irregardless of who's in attendance!

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Reuben Barlow - Art Collector: The subject of an ongoing case. Possibly obtained some of his paintings through unsavory means.
- Sophia Bird - Celebrity: Your girlfriend! An accomplished actress.
- Jim Hudson - Mayor: He had you dig up dirt on his competition during the last election. He likely wouldn't be mayor if it weren't for you.
- Daniel Pierce - Wine Collector: He's had you snoop out some rare wines.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
