Hi Alannah!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Rakeeta Brown.

You are a secretary at one of the law offices in town. As such, you tend to overhear quite a lot! You don't actively eavesdrop and actually do your best to avoid it, but that can only be so effective. The event on Saturday is an auction for a chef who has passed that is very well respected. You are in attendance with your boyfriend, Reuben Barlow.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Reuben Barlow - Art Collector: You two have been dating for a number of years.
- Milo Steinwell - Lawyer: Milo is one of the Lawyers who works at your office. You and him get along well enough, though you've overheard him talking about the Mayor a number of times.
- Elizabeth Cain - Humanitarian: You use to work as Elizabeth's secretary at the non-profit she is now director of, Fine Cuisine for Impoverished Teens. She was a great boss, but being at a non-profit the pay and benefits couldn't come close to what you got offered at the Law offices.
- Darren Kaufman - Franchise Owner: Darren is the owner of WcRonald's. You had a run in with him two years ago, after you slipped and injured yourself at his restaurant with no signage posted. You sued, using a lawyer you don't work with so as not to draw suspicion, and ultimately settled very heavily in your favor.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
