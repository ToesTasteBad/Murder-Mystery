Hi Brady!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Jim Hudson.

You are the mayor of Flavortown and are very well connected. To be honest, you achieved the mayorship through some... unsavory means, but you've heard that they're justified by the ends. Saturday's event is for one of Flavortown's greatest chefs, Rigatoni Alfredo, who has recently passed. You'll schmooze and carouse and talk solemly about how the loss of Alfredo is a great blow to the city. That should earn you a rating point or two. Maybe you'll even make a good impression on a certain senator who is supposed to be in attendance.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Milo Steinwell - Lawyer: A fine lawyer. He's defended you in the past, and had the good sense to keep those cases to himself during the election.
- Keith Hartley - Detective: Helped you dig up some dirt on your opponent during the election and get it out into the public anonymously.
- Stephen Ramos - Senator: He could be your ticket to even greater political heights!
- Giovanni Bishop - Vinter: You used to golf all the time, but he's been busy this season.
- Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector: Another golfing buddy, and a fine and upstanding local businessperson.
- Harvey Davenport - Food Critic: The last member of your golf crew.
- Penelope Hunt - Realtor: You're dating!

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
