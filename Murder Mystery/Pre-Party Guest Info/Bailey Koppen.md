Hi Bailey!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Puck Augustini.

Saturday's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, the world's greatest chef. He taught you everything you know, and after he passed, he left his restaurant to you. He also left some big shoes to fill, and despite your skill as a chef, you've been feeling the pressure to live up to his reputation. His son, Orzo Alfredo, is hosting Saturday's event and auctioning off some of Rigatoni's prized possessions, including his favorite apron. You're certain that Rigatoni would have given it to you if he'd had the chance. Maybe you can win it at the auction?

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Blair Ashleigh - Model: You're dating!
- Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner: The owner of La Bouffe. Now that you've taken over your mentor's restaurant, he's your top competition in town. He seems to be using the transfer as an opportunity to steal some of your business.
- Arthur Cooke - Head Chef: A talented chef at La Bouffe. Your work is often compared, but there's no bad blood between you.
- Orzo Alfredo - Rigatoni's Eldest Child: Your mentor's eldest son. Despite all the time you spent with his father, you haven't seen him around much. He seems to be more active in his father's death than he was in his life.
- Ziti Alfredo - Rigatoni's Second Child: Your mentor's younger son. Now here's a man who appreciates cooking. You get the feeling he would have liked his father's mentorship if only he had more talent for cooking.
- Frank Larsen - Bartender: He was the bartender at Alfredo's. He seemed to do a good job and got along well with your mentor, but when Rigatoni passed, Frank left to work at La Bouffe shortly thereafter.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
