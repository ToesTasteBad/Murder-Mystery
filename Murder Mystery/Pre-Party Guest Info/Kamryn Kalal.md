Hi Kamryn!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Penelope Hunt.

You are a realtor who has managed to break into the wealthy crowd and have been selling high commission homes for a number of years. Saturday's event is to commemorate the death of world renowned chef, Rigatoni Alfredo. Being the well connected individual you are, you managed to snag an invitation to the event, which you've heard is an auction of sorts. You are hoping that perhaps his decendants are trying to sell his property and are still looking for a realtor to help them out! In addition, you've had a number of clients express interest in the mansion that the party is taking place at and perhaps you can sweet talk the host into naming his price!

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Vladimir Grey - General: General Grey tasked you with selling his cabin several months ago, and you were excited to take on the job! There's just been one problem. He demands that you sell the place at well over the appraisal value, and no one is buying. What's more, he's losing patience quickly.
- Nathan Cain - Philanthropist: Nathan Cain (a local rich dude) has decided to turn over a new leaf, and has been selling his many extravagant properties. This has been a serious windfall for you, and a consistent source of income, but they're running out.
- Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector: *Extreme* interest has been expressed in Toussaint's mansion. You've mentioned to him before that the market could be quite generous to him if he were willing to sell, but he seemed uninterested.
- James Hudson - Mayor: You're dating, and one of the few people who call him James.
- Milo Steinwell - Lawyer: You've gone down some pretty different career paths since college, but you used to be good friends!

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
