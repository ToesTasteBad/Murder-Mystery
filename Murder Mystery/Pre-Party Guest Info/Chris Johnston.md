Hi Chris!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Nathan Cain.

You are a prominent business man who has made his fortune through oil. Your oil company has been in your family for generations and has made you very wealthy. You were content to hoard your wealth until you met your now-wife, an incredible woman who taught you how fullfilling it can be to give. Your new mission is to give as much as you can to worthy charities before you die, and Saturday's event may offer an opportunity to do just that! The famous chef, Rigatoni Alfedo, has recently passed away, and a charity auction is being held in his honor.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Vladimir Grey - General: He is your father in law.
- Penelope Hunt - Realtor: You've been selling properties like crazy, and Penelope has been helping you do that.
- Stephen Ramos - Senator: You're one of his campaign's top donators, but your recent change of heart has made you decide to take your money out of politics.
- Elizabeth Cain - Humanitarian: She's you wife!

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
