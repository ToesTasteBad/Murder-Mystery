Hi Tadd!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Vladimir Grey.

You are an accomplished General in the US army. Tonight's event is an auction for the recently departed, renowned chef Rigatoni Alfredo. You met Rigatoni at basic many years ago and became quite good friends. You haven't spoken in a number of years but have been closely following his success.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Penelope Hunt - Realtor: She is the realtor you've hired to sell your summer cabin, but she's not been able to attract a decent offer and you're getting impatient with her.
- Nathan Cain  - Philanthropist: Your Son-in-Law, who is also using Penelope Hunt's services to sell his estates
- Stephen Ramos - Senator: You've met with Stephen a few times over the years regarding military matters. It just so happens a big vote regarding the military's budget is coming up, and you are hoping to persuade him to vote in favor.
- Elizabeth Cain - Humanitarian: You are Elizabeth's dad.
- Sophia Bird - Celebrity: You are one of Sophia's biggest fans and absolutely love the new movie she was just in. You're very excited she's going to be at this party.
- Jodi Souvid - TV Host: You two went to highschool together! You weren't friends per say but  got along just fine. It's been awhile since you've seen each other.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
