Hi Tom!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Ziti Alfredo.

Saturday's event is to commemorate your father, Rigatoni Alfredo, who recently passed away. You were very close. He taught you how to cook, and even though you didn't have the talent to do it professionally, you enjoy making his recipes for your family on a daily basis. Your older brother, Orzo Alfredo, is in charge of managing your father's estate, and is the organizer of Saturday's event. He and your father didn't get along, and you don't often see eye to eye. He decided to auction off your father's prized possessions for charity, including his chef knife, which you weren't happy about.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host: She did an episode on some of your father's most famous dishes and had you on as a guest chef. She seems nice, but a bit more focused on the showmanship than the cooking.
- Orzo Alfredo - Rigatoni's Eldest Child: Your older brother. He was never interested in the family business and hasn't been around much. You had assumed that managing your father's estate would fall to you, but it's good to see him so gung-ho.
- Puck Augustini - Rigatoni's Protege: Your father's protege. Maybe that could have been you if you'd had a bit more talent. He took over your father's restaurant when he passed.
- Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner: The owner of La Bouffe, Alfredo's main competition in town.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
