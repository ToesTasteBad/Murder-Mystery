Hi Andrew!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Giovanni Bishop.

You own what is indisputably the finest vineyard in the state. Saturday's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, an excellent chef and an important business partner of yours. The event is an auction where some of his most prized possessions are being sold.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Rueben Barlow - Art Collector: You are in possession of an original Devoux. It is a prized piece of your collection and you have no intention of parting with it, though you know Rueben has been vying to get it off you for a while now.
- Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector: Gregor has been an esteemed customer of yours for a while. You've sold many expensive bottles to him over the years and you've developed quite the relationship. He is one of your top investors at the vineyard.
- Anton Sherman - Sommelier: You have been in business with Anton for a number of years now. He stamps his signature on the labels of the bottles he most recommends. These bottles always sell the best. However, costs at the vineyard are running high and you are looking for ways to save money. You've informed Anton you will be cutting his kick back percentage.
- Poppy Steinwell - Health Inspector: You and Poppy are both members of a golfing foursome!  However, you've been far too busy at the vineyard this season and haven't been able to get out at all. You are hoping to catch up with them on the latest gossip at the event.
- Harvey Davenport - Food Critic: Good golfing buddy of yours! 
- Jim Hudson - Mayor: Another one of your golfing buddies. You used to golf even before he became mayor.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
