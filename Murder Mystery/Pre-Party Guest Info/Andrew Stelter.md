Hi Andrew!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Anton Sherman.

You are a professional wine taster, and your reviews are some of the most trusted in the industry. 
Saturday's event is in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo, an incredible chef who recently passed away. He would always come to you for advice. Also in attendance are a couple of wine collectors. One is the host. They may love wine, but not the same way you do. Your pallete can detect flavors they could only dream of, and yet they keep some of the world's best bottles to themselves, treating them as nothing more than status symbols. If you play your cards right, you may be able to get a taste of some of their hoarded wines.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Gregor Toussaint - Wine Collector: You've had some disagreements over the years on what makes a bottle of wine truly excellent. He may claim he knows what he's talking about, but you see right through his shallow knowledge and experience.
- Jodi Souvid - Food TV Host: You have reached out to Jodi, who is an old friend of yours, about doing an episode all about wine. You are hoping some new exposure could boost the need for your services a bit.
- Giovanni Bishop - Vinter: You have been in business with Giovanni for a number of years now. You stamp your label on the bottles of his you recommend and you get a certain percentage kick back for every bottle sold. You two have come to a bit of a disagreement though, as he is trying to cut your kick back percentage.
- Harvey Davenport - Food Critic: You and Harvey have been talking about starting a shared review column together, talking about the best food and wine pairings in Flavortown and surrounding areas. You two are still figuring out the details.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
