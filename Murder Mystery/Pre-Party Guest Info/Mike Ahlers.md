Hi Mike!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Reuben Barlow.

You are an art collector and proprieter of Gallery 16 on the West side of town. You've sold numerous paintings to many in attendance at the night's event. The event in question? An auction for world class chef, Rigatoni Alfredo, who has recently passed. You sold him a remarkable piece a number of years back which he hung in his restaurant. Hopefully, the new management keeps it that way.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Giovanni Bishop - Vinter: The owner of an original Devoux painting. He claims he'll never part with it, but everyone has their price.
- Daniel Pierce - Wine Collector: A good friend. You listen to all of his wine ramblings, and in return, he listens to all of your insight on art.
- Blair Ashleigh - Model: Recently wore a print of one of the pieces in your collection during a photo shoot. A little bit blasphemous, but the publicity was worth it.
- Keith Hartley - Detective: He's been seen snooping around your gallery. This makes you a bit nervous because, to be honest, not all of your pieces were acquired by entirely *legal* methods.
- Rakeeta Brown - Secretary: You two have been dating for a number of years.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you so
