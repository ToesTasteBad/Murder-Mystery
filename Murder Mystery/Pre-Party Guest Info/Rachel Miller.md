Hi Rachel!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Blair Ashleigh.

You're a model who's recently been gaining some extreme popularity. Saturday's event is an auction in honor of Rigatoni Alfredo, the famous chef. He was your boyfriend's mentor, and Puck seems seriously broken up about his death. You're attending to support Puck, but it's also a great opportunity to rub shoulders with some of the city's elite. Apparently, most of them will be in attendance.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Diana Savilee - Fashion Designer: You've been approached by Diana numerous times to model some of her clothing. You've repeatedly told her her work isn't your style.
- Reuben Barlow - Art Collector: You wore a print of one of his pieces and got rave reviews. You're thinking of doing it again.
- Sophia Bird - Celebrity: You and Sophia were good friends before your modeling career took off. She is now a bit curt with you. You suspect she isn't happy someone else in town is stealing some of her spotlight.
- Puck Agustini - Rigatoni's Protege: You two are currently dating.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
