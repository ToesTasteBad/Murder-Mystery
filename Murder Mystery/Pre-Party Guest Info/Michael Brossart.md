Hi Michael!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Stephen Ramos.

By day, you're a senator for the state of Minnesota. By night, an enjoyer of the finest cuisine Flavortown has to offer. This event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, an incredible chef. You were a frequent patron of his restaurant and have spent many evenings chatting with and enjoying the fine cocktails prepared by his bartender, Frank Larsen. In your spouse's opinion, you've been chatting with him a bit too much. As a senator, you're privy to a fair amount of classified information, and you may have recently let some state secrets slip. You trust the man, but your spouse seems very nervous about the whole thing. You're going to Saturday's event in part to make absolutely certain he stays quiet. And of course, you've never been one to say no to a fancy party.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Rebecca Ramos - Author: Your wife! You two are currently in an argument over the secret that was shared with the bartender. She wants to help, but you have it covered!
- Frank Larsen - Bartender: You may have recently let slip some insider secrets while enjoying his fine cocktails. You're hoping to bribe him to keep quiet at the party.
- Vladimir Grey - General: You have a vote coming up on the mlitary budget for the upcoming year. It's close, and your vote could end up slashing the military budget, or bolstering it. General Grey has been pestering you to "show a little generosity" for the last few weeks.
- Nathan Cain - Philanthropist: Nathan Cain has been a long time donator to your campaign!

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
