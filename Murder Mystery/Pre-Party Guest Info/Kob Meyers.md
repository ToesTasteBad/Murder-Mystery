Hi Kob!

Our black tie Halloween murder mystery is just around the corner, and there are few things you need to know before you attend.

You will be playing Arthur Cooke.

You are the head chef at La Bouffe, one of the finest restaurants in Flavortown. Saturday's event is to commemorate the death of Rigatoni Alfredo, a chef you've always respected and considered a rival for years. People often compare you, and a review by Harvey Davenport cemented him as the better chef in the minds of many. You never held it against Alfredo though. You both drove each other to improve your cooking, and you wouldn't be the chef you are today without him.

Here are a few people you may recognize at the party:

- Frank Larsen - Bartender: Came to La Bouffe after Alfredo's death. He refuses to cater his drinks to your dishes. Very annoying fellow.
- Erik Howell - Restaurant Owner: He's been driving you particularly hard since Alfredo's death. He wants everyone to know who the best chef in town is now that he's gone.
- Puck Augustini - Rigatoni's Protege: A formiddable chef and a hard worker. You look forward to watching him grow.
- Harvey Davenport - Food Critic: Responsible for your reputation as the second best chef in town. You haven't spoken, but you get the feeling he's a bit of a snob.

The party will start at 7:00pm on Saturday the 29th and the murder mystery will begin at 7:30pm, so make sure to show up by then! See you soon!
